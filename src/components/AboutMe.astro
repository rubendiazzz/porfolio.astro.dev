      My name is Ruben Diaz. I started coding 8 years ago when I was aged 11
      making simple programs and websites.<strong
        >I am currently studying at 42 Malaga Campus, rapidly getting stronger
        and better on logic and solving problems.</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the knowledge I have acquired since I started coding its been
      <strong
        >autodidact watching YouTube tutorials or doing paid and free courses
        such as in CodeCademy.com or Udemy.com.</strong
      > Since then, I have discovered that Web Development and Software Development
      are my passion. Also, I have studied the first year of Game Development Bachelor
      in the American University of Malta trying to find my thing.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>As an autodidact developer</strong> I have faced lots of problems like
      the <strong>lack of motivation</strong> or just trying to find my area and
      specialising.
    </p>

	<p>
		Now I am currently working at Telefonica Tech at Malaga as a <strong>Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Analyst 24x7</strong>.
